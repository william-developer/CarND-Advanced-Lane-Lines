    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the file called `camera_calibrator.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then use the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I apply this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtain this result: \n",

    "### Pipeline (single images)\n",
    "\n",

    "To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image called `combine_gradient()` (thresholding steps at lines 77 through 110 in `lane_functions.py`).  \n",
    "The first step, I take the derivative in x by function `cv2.Sobel`,and set threshold x gradient as (20, 100).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Sobel x\n",
    "    sobelx = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0) # Take the derivative in x\n",
    "    abs_sobelx = np.absolute(sobelx) # Absolute x derivative to accentuate lines away from horizontal\n",
    "    scaled_sobel = np.uint8(255*abs_sobelx/np.max(abs_sobelx))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Threshold x gradient\n",
    "    (thresh_min,thresh_max) = sx_thresh\n",
    "    sxbinary = np.zeros_like(scaled_sobel)\n",
    "    sxbinary[(scaled_sobel >= thresh_min) & (scaled_sobel <= thresh_max)] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second step, I convert image to HLS color space and separate the S channel,and setting Threshold color channel as (170, 255).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Convert to HLS color space and separate the S channel\n",
    "    hls = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HLS)\n",
    "    s_channel = hls[:,:,2]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Threshold color channel\n",
    "    (s_thresh_min,s_thresh_max) = s_thresh\n",
    "    s_binary = np.zeros_like(s_channel)\n",
    "    s_binary[(s_channel >= s_thresh_min) & (s_channel <= s_thresh_max)] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The last step,I combine the two binary thresholds.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Stack each channel to view their individual contributions in green and blue respectively\n",
    "    # This returns a stack of the two binary images, whose components you can see as different colors\n",
    "    color_binary = np.dstack(( np.zeros_like(sxbinary), sxbinary, s_binary)) * 255\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warp_perspective()`, which appears in lines 112 through 131 in the file `lane_functions.py`.  The `warp_perspective()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",

    "| 687, 460      | 960, 0        |\n",
    "\n",
    "I verify that my perspective transform is working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?\n",
    "Firstly,I find starting point by using peak position of histogram.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "     # Take a histogram of the bottom half of the image\n",

    "     # Find the peak of the left and right halves of the histogram\n",
    "     # These will be the starting point for the left and right lines\n",
    "     midpoint = np.int(histogram.shape[0]/2)\n",
    "     leftx_base = np.argmax(histogram[:midpoint])\n",
    "     rightx_base = np.argmax(histogram[midpoint:]) + midpoint\n",

    "Secondly,I find all points through the windows one by one.(lines 165 through 190)\n",

    "   for window in range(nwindows):\n",
    "   ...\n",

    "I calculate the radius of curvature of the lane in lines 215 through 221 in my code in `lane_functions.py` in the function `curvature_radius_meter()`.\n",

    "When converting to a bird's eye view, I need to make 4 points of the original image, and then find the 4 points of the bird's eye view, which is more difficult. It is necessary to adjust the parameters for a long time, and the influence of the parameters on the transform matrix is large, and the transform matrix can affect the location of the lane. Moreover, the image quality of each frame is different. The image with low quality (the lane was not clear) could not locate the lane or find the lane accurately when making aerial view. In this scenario, the program could not work well. In the actual scene, the image of each frame may have a situation that lane blurred . However, it is good to use the characteristic of frame which is continuous, and the curvature deviation between successive frames is very small. When the lane is unclear, the mean lane lines of the few preceding frames can be fine. It is more robust, and the result will be better.\n",
